# Improve your multi-module app build configuration with convention plugins

## Introduction

Last year at Nabla, when I wanted to create new feature, I had to:
1. create a new module on Android Studio
2. Copy-paste from the project README.md into the new module `build.gradle.kts`
3. Remove some code I don't need

It was painful and we had around 100 modules.

In this talk, I will explain to you how to remedy this.
