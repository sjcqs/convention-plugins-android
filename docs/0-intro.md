# Improve your multi-module app build configuration with convention plugins

## Introduction

Author: Satyan Jacquens, Android developer

When I worked at Nabla, when I wanted to create new feature, I had to:
1. create a new module on Android Studio
2. copy-paste some code from the project README.md into the new module `build.gradle.kts`
3. Remove some code I wouldn't need

It was painful, we had around 100 modules, and were developing 1-2 new features each month. 

In this talk, I will explain what I have done to remedy this.
