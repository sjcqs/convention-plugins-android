# Improve your multi-module app build configuration with convention plugins
Author: Satyan Jacquens, Android developer

When I worked at Nabla, we had a multi-module application, when I wanted to create new feature, I had to:
1. create a new module on Android Studio
2. copy-paste code into the `build.gradle.kts` (from the project README.md) 
3. Remove some code I wouldn't need

It was painful, we had around 100 modules, and were developing 1-2 new features each month. 

In this talk, I will explain what I have done to remedy this and how I improved the developer experience at Nabla.
